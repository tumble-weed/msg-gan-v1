__TODO__:
- even patch sizes seem to be presenting problems for patch sampling and then reconstruction. The required number of patches for reconstruction is an odd number that means that the number of patches to ignore is not going to be symmetric ( for e.g. for a 32x56 image, 29x53 patches of size 4x4 are required, but ignoring symmetrically leads to 28x52)

# MSG-GAN
**MSG-GAN (Multi-Scale Gradients GAN)**: A Network architecture inspired from the [ProGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10196.pdf).

The architecture of this gan contains connections between the intermediate 
layers of the singular Generator and the Discriminator. 
The network is **not** trained by progressively growing the layers. All the layers
get trained at the same time.

Implementation uses the **`PyTorch`** framework.

**Please note that all the samples at various scales are generated by the network simultaneously.**

## Multi-Scale Gradients architecture

</p>

<p>
The above figure describes the architecture of the proposed 
Multi-Scale gradients GAN. As you can notice, from every intermediate layer
of the Generator, a particular resolution image is extracted through 
(1 x 1) convolutions. These extracted images are in turn fed to the appropriate 
layers of the Discriminator. This allows for gradients to flow from the Discriminator
to the Generator at multiple scales.
</p> <br>

<p>
For the discrimination process, appropriately downsampled 
versions of the real images are fed to corresponding layers of the discriminator 
as shown in the diagram.
</p> <br>

<p>
The problem of occurence of random gradients for GANs at the higher resolutions 
is tackled by layerwise training in the ProGAN paper. 
I present another solution for it. I have run the following experiment that 
preliminarily validates the proposed approach.

Above figure explains how the Meaningful Gradients penetrate the Generator from Bottoms-up. Initially, only the lower resolution gradients are menaingful and thus start generating good images at those resolutions, but eventually, all the scales synchronize and start producing images. This results in a stabler training for the higher resolution.

## Celeba Experiment
I ran the experiment on a skimmed version of the architecture as described in the 
ProGAN paper. Following table summarize the details of the Networks: <br>

<img alt="detailed_architecture" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akanimax/MSG-GAN/master/detailed_architecture.jpg"
     width=50% height=50% />
</p>
<br>

For extracting images after every 3 layer block at that resolution, I used 
**1 x 1** convolutions. Similar operation is performed for feeding the images to 
discriminator intermediate layers.

The architecture for the discriminator is also the same (reverse mirror), 
with the distinction that half of the channels come from 
the (1 x 1 convolution) transformed downsampled real images 
and half from conventional top-to-bottom path.

All the **3 x 3 convolution** weights have a forward hook that applies 
**`spectral normalization`** on them. Apart from that, in the discriminator
for the **4 x 4** layer, there is a **MinibatchStd** layer for improving 
sample diversity. **No other stablization techniques are applied.**

The above diagrams are the loss plots obtained during 
training the Networks in an adversarial manner. The loss function used is 
**`Relativistic Hinge-GAN`**. Apart from some initial aberrations, the training
has stayed smooth.

## Running the Code
**Please note to use value of `learning_rate=0.0003` for both G and D for all experiments.
TTUR doesn't work with this architecture (from experience). And, you can find other better 
learning rates, but the value `0.0003` always seems to work.**

Running the training is actually very simple. 
Just start the training by running the `train.py` script in the `sourcecode/`

## Running 1024 x 1024 architecture
For training a network as per the ProGAN CelebaHQ experiment, 
use the following arguments:

    $ python train.py --depth=9 \
                      --latent_size=512 \
                      --images_dir=<path to CelebaHQ images> \
                      --sample_dir=samples/CelebaHQ_experiment \
                      --model_dir=models/CelebaHQ_experiment

Set the `batch_size`, `feedback_factor` and `checkpoint_factor` accordingly.
This experiment was carried out by me on a **DGX-1** machine. The samples displayed in Figure 1. of this readme are the output of this experiment.
You can use the models pretrained for 3 epochs at **[1024 x 1024]** for your training. These are available at -> https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/119n0CoMDGq2K1dnnGpOA3gOf4RwFAGFs
